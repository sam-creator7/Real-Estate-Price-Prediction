# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

This is a machine learning project aimed at predicting real estate prices. The project uses the Python programming language and various libraries such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn to perform data processing, feature engineering, and model training/evaluation. The training and test data is read into a pandas data frame and various preprocessing steps are performed, including filling in missing values, scaling/normalizing the numerical features, and one-hot encoding the categorical features. A principal component analysis (PCA) is then applied to the preprocessed data to reduce the number of features and avoid overfitting. Finally, a machine learning model is trained on the preprocessed data and used to make predictions on the test set.
